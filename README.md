# Mosaic

Mosaic is a browser tool for beginning hand knitters to visualise knitting patterns.

## Motivation

While there were a few Github repositories of projects which aimed to achieve visualisation of knitting patterns, they were in Python and not in Javascript - making it inaccessible to members of the knitting community who are not programmers. Mosaic intends to be easily accessible for everyone and as such opts for a browser implementation.

The only other website which is similar to this project is http://www.columbia.edu/~syy2114/knitting-visualizer/. Missing functionalities are the ability to do color work (such as mosaic), and there are a few bugs in regards to their editor, being unresponsive at times. There are also missed stitches such as decreases and increases. Furthermore, the code is not open source, which I aim to plug this gap.

I also intend to increase my own knitting skills and vocabulary while improving the functionality of this website.

## Technology Stack

Mosaic uses Javascript and the React library.
